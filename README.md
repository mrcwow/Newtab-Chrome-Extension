# Newtab-Chrome-Extension
Permission for tabs is needed to access the tab URL to change only chrome://newtab/.
Current page to newtab is chrome://new-tab-page, which allows you to use other search engines, but with newtab from Google.
In addition, you can configure the page at startup on the page in Chrome: chrome://settings/onStartup.
